{"name":"Huke","tagline":"The best and worst programming language ever made.","body":"Huke (Hard to Understand Puke) is an *esoteric* programming language written in pure, standard C, and based of the [Befunge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge). It's similiar to [Malborge](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malbolge), [Parenthetic](https://github.com/cammckinnon/Parenthetic), and all those other little (and weird) little language we know and love.\r\n\r\n### Installing\r\n\r\nPretty simple:\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n$ git clone https://github.com/beakr/huke.git\r\n$ make\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Writing some Huke scripts\r\n\r\nHuke is a very messy, weird language, but very fun to mess around with. Many programmers use languages like Befunge just to see what they can make out of complex symbols and patterns. Here's a simple program that prints \"Hello\" in Huke:\r\n\r\n```befunge\r\n\"!olleH\",,,,,,@\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe string procedure \"!olleH\", which has six characters in it (declared by the commas), is printed and then `@` is used to terminate the program. Once you run `make` you can just run `./huke program.hk` to run your simple Huke script.\r\n\r\nFor some more scripts I highly recommend checking out the `/samples` directory in the [Github repo](https://github.com/beakr/huke). For a Befunge reference, check out the [Wikipedia article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Befunge).\r\n\r\n### Differences to Befunge\r\n\r\n*None yet*...","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
